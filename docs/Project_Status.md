## Next Steps

1. **Research Tasks**:
   - Complete state-specific regulatory research for all target states
   - Verify all regulatory references against official sources
   - Develop comprehensive regulatory interpretation guide
   
2. **Policy Development Tasks**:
   - Draft remaining policy sections
   - Create appendices and supporting materials
   - Develop implementation tools (checklists, forms, etc.)
   
3. **Repository Management**:
   - Establish GitHub permissions and collaboration workflow
   - Set up branch protection and review requirements
   - Organize PDF resources and reference materials

## Current Challenges

1. **Regulatory Complexity**: Navigating differences between federal OSHA and state plans
2. **Implementation Guidance**: Developing practical tools that support policy compliance
3. **Repository Access**: Resolving GitHub authentication for pushing changes

## Resource Requirements

1. **Information Needs**:
   - Access to state-specific OSHA regulations
   - Industry best practice documents
   - Example implementation tools
   
2. **Technical Needs**:
   - GitHub authentication solution
   - PDF extraction capability for regulatory text
   - Version control strategy

## Timeline Update

The project is currently on track with the 12-week timeline outlined in the Research Plan. Weeks 1-2 focusing on regulatory research and initial policy development have been completed.

Next phase (Weeks 3-6) will focus on completing the remaining policy sections and beginning implementation tool development.
